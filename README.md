## What is whiteout?
Whiteout is a bunch of themes I've been making over a long period of time all specializing in being white, and having the same colorscheme (Tomorrow) however it doesn't quite follow the standards of Tomorrow. It should also be noted some of these themes don't necesarrily have the colorscheme, some may get the colors through your Xresources, your GTK theme, terminal color scheme etc etc.

### What branches of this theme exists?
 - [**Firefox theme** (Browser)](https://github.com/0neGuyDev/firefox-whiteout)
 - [**Micro theme** (Text editor)](https://github.com/0neGuyDev/micro-whiteout)
 - **GTK theme** (WIP - System)
 - [**Ulauncher Theme** (App Launcher)](https://github.com/0neGuyDev/ulauncher-whiteout)
 - **New Tab** (Idea - Browser extension)
 - **Many themes for websites** (WIP - Browser)
 - _**More to come...**_

I usually work on these themes when I got the time (Not often because of school) since I don't have many other side projects currently.
