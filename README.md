## What is whiteout?
Whiteout is a bunch of themes I've been making over a long period of time all specializing in being white, and having the same colorscheme (Tomorrow) however it doesn't quite follow the standards of Tomorrow.

### What branches of this theme exists?
 - **New Tab** (Idea - Browser extension)
 - **GTK theme** (WIP - System) 
 - [**Micro theme** (Text editor)](https://github.com/0neGuyDev/micro-whiteout)
 - **Firefox theme** (WIP - Browser)
 - **VSCode/Codium theme** (WIP - Text editor)
 - **Many themes for websites** (WIP - Browser)
 - _**More to come...**_
 
I have plans to do other programs as well, such one for Discord (With BetterDiscord ofc) however I don't use Discord that often and when I do I do it in the terminal, so I'd have to install it to then make the theme, which might be what I have to do.

Also I don't really use VSCode/Codium anymore, so there's some things that aren't totally finished, but that's a minor issue and I may or may not finish it.

I usually work on these themes when I got the time (Not often because of school) since I don't have many other side projects currently.
